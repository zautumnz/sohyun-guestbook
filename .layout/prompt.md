This is a vite template that supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons.

Guidelines:
- Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them
- Use icons from Lucide React
- Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist

CRITICAL RULE: NEVER WRITE \`package.json\` directly use npm comands to install packages if needed
