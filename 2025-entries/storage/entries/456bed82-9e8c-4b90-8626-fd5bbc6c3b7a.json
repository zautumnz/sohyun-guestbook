      "content": "I'm having such a great time in my life because of sohyun. Her personality is so close to mine. I'm also a book warm and love to write songs and compose them. I wish i could show the songs I've written to sohyun. I'm also a silent person like her who doesn't talk a lot. So i have to say she's literally my twin from another country. I also enjoy almost all the songs sohyun recommends. Also every song she's written and composed. She's such a genius. And a Pinterest aesthetic queen. I love her posts sm and the way she takes selfies. Most people see her as a masc but i see her as a cutie and a great artist who's an ace in every aspect. Not to mention i really love sohyun's deep voice when she sings and her cute little laugh. I hope people would break through the shell and see how warm she is, not judging her from outside. She's the sweetest and the kindest cutie. I'll be waiting to spend more years with sohyun. Stay healthy and happy on this birthday my sweet girl. You deserve all the happiness in the world ðŸ©·"
