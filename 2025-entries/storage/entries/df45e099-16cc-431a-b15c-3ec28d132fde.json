The second time I saw you was the viral clip of you in the baseball stadium. Then I decided to watch signal from beginning, when I found out that you produce songs and producing Dejavu, I decided to stan you. Your soft words, advices and actions are admirable. Your journey and humane sides made me realize how special life is and itâ€™s worth trying. Keep on doing things you love. Please take care of yourself and just know that we are by your side no matter what. Thank you so much.\n\nBelow is the picture of Sohyun that I love the most. Happy birthday to you S14, Park Sohyun."
