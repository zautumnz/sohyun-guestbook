I was going through such a hard time and struggling mentally and GND really helped me pick myself up. You have been my bias since the day I became a WAV whenever I watch any of your livestreamâ€™s or SIGNALâ€™s I instantly smile and laugh, you are such a bright and bubbly person and can always put a smile on someoneâ€™s face. Please always remember that your members and WAVâ€™s all around the world cherish you and love you so so much you are doing an amazing job and you deserve all the happiness in the worldâ™¡\n\nHappy BirthdayðŸ’™"
