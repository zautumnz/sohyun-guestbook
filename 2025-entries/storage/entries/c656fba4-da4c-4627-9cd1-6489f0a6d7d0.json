The more I get to know about you — your voice, your smile, your kindness, and your passion — the deeper I fall for your endless charm.\n\nI’m currently a 12th grader, and life has been really busy and tiring with school, organizations, competitions, and volunteering. There are days when I feel completely exhausted, but somehow, listening to your songs and your song recommendations always makes me feel calm again. Your voice has this magic that heals me and gives me the strength to keep going.\n\nThere are so many things I want to say, but above all — thank you. Thank you for being my light during stressful times. Thank you for reminding me that it’s okay to rest and to take things one step at a time. Even from far away, you make me feel understood and less alone.\n\nYou’ve inspired me in so many ways, Sohyun unnie. Because of you, I’ve learned to love myself more and to believe in my own pace. You truly mean so much to me.\n\nI hope your birthday is filled with laughter, love, and every little thing that makes you happy. You deserve all the joy in the world, today and always. Please stay healthy, keep smiling, and know that there’s a WAV from Indonesia who’ll keep cheering for you no matter what. ❤️\n\nWith all my love,\nShofia,"
