This was about half vibe-coded (Claude Sonnet and Opus in Zed). It's buggy and insecure and weird. That's okay, it only had to last for a couple weeks.

It was at <https://sohyun-guestbook.onrender.com>

Usage:

```
npm i
npm run dev
npm run dev:full
npm t
npm run test:api
npm run build
```

### Bugs:

* Jump to page allows letters
* Entries flicker when loading pages on Firefox
* Use assets/entry-format to signify the sub-entry type
* Add a wolf emoji on the scrollbar thumb
* Still messed up on larger screens
